# SurveyManagerV2

UNYT Web System Development course project

### Project Design

The project is built using PHP, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, while MySQL is used as the database management system.

The project is object-oriented and built using the *MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller)* to logically structure the code
on components that are built to handle specific development aspects of the application.

Another pattern used is *DAO (Data Access Object)* which is a pattern that provides an abstract interface to the
database. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, DAO provides specific data operations without exposing
details of the database.

### Functionalities

The project is functional to both unregistered and system users. However, while to the system user is granted a range of
functionalities like creating, maintaining, publishing, analyzing statistics of their survey entries and more; the
non-registered user can only anonymously fill out surveys. For further testing purposes use either one of the
